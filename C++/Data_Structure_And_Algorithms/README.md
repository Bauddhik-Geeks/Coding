# Data_Structure & Algorithms

### This repository contains all the coding problems solved by me.

* Find all topic wise questions in different folders:)
* From Basic to Hard level questions under each topic
* Separate folders for CP (Codechef and Codeforces).. All Solutions are not optimised 
* Possibility that many questions repeat in same folder or under different topic.
* Multiple Solutions are given for problems (eg. Some problems can be solved using different data-strutures, so multiple solutions are there, maps, sets, brute force, optimised code, etc)
 
## Big O Notation

### Sorting Algorithms in Big O Notiation
| Sort Algorithm | Best | Average | Worst | Space Complexity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selection Sort | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Insertion Sort | ```O(n)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(1)``` |
| Quick Sort | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(n^2)``` | ```O(log n)``` |
| Merge Sort | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(log n)``` | ```O(n)``` |
